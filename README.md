Daryl's Palace
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dwatson62/daryls_palace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dwatson62/daryls_palace) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dwatson62/daryls_palace/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dwatson62/daryls_palace)

## Synopsis

This is a merge between two earlier projects:

[Blackjack](https://github.com/dwatson62/blackjack)
[Roulette](https://github.com/dwatson62/roulette)

Available on Heroku: [Daryl's Palace](https://daryls-palace.herokuapp.com/) although it is rather slow.

Daryl's Palace is a casino currently with the following games:

- Blackjack [README](https://github.com/dwatson62/daryls_palace/blob/master/blackjackREADME.md)
- Roulette [README](https://github.com/dwatson62/daryls_palace/blob/master/rouletteREADME.md)

In the future I would like to add more games to this list. Perhaps pontoon or slot machines. Maybe I'll add in a bar like with PKR.

Users can register and sign in/out. Player balance starts at Â£100 and can be used across both games. The balance gets updated with every hand/round played. The blackjack game now has a computer playing, who is a serious player and follows basic strategy perfectly.
