Daryl's Palace
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dwatson62/daryls_palace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dwatson62/daryls_palace) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/dwatson62/daryls_palace/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/dwatson62/daryls_palace)

## Synopsis

This is a merge between two earlier projects:

[(https://github.com/dwatson62/blackjack)](https://github.com/dwatson62/blackjack)
[(https://github.com/dwatson62/roulette)](https://github.com/dwatson62/roulette)

Daryl's Palace is a casino currently with two games, Blackjack and Roulette. Specific documentation for each game is available at the above links. In the future I would like to add more games to this list.

Users can register and sign in/out. Player balance starts at Â£100 and can be used across both games. The balance gets updated with every hand/round played. The blackjack game now has a computer playing, who is a serious player and follows basic strategy perfectly.

Unit tests are working correctly. I have not been able to test user logins, and due to each game requiring a login beforehand this means that protractor tests are currently broken.

- ``` git clone https://github.com/dwatson62/daryls_palace ```
